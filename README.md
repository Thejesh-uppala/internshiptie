- Our project “LEAF NOW” is a website for plant enthusiast who can sell, donate and buy the plants which they need. 
- Ever since industrialisation started the care for plants has made it to our least priority list, Even though mankind requires plants to balance the food chain that he’s a part of, but the plant enthusiasts are everywhere, be it big metropolitan cities or rural areas, so we aim to bring in a platform that can connect these plant/nature enthusiasts 
- And help them exchange/sell them plants or donate seeds/plants as part of the green initiative that we started 2 years back.
